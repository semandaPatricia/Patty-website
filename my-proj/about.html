          <div class="">ABOUT HALLE AGENCY</div>
        
      Established in 2013 in New York City, Halle Agency is one of the leading boutique agencies representing a diverse pool of models and talent for print and commercial advertising. Our unique niche, housing both a fashion and a lifestyle division in one agency, is what sets Bella apart in a highly competitive industry.
      
      In 2005, Bella launched its successful 40+ WOMEN division (now Bella CLASSIC), which quickly became the most sought-after resource for advertisers looking to target that demographic. In 2017, with an increased demand as well as a growing bicoastal talent pool, Bella Los Angeles opened its doors. We have since expanded our portfolio to represent on-camera, commercial talent (Bella TALENT) and youth (Bella YOUTH).
      
      With the rise of social media marketing, Bella has stood at the forefront of recognizing and adapting to the demands of advertisers and marketers. Bella INFLUENCERS was established to provide our clients with talent who have a strong social media presence.
      
      Our models and talent have appeared in numerous marketing campaigns including Uniqlo, Target, Levi's, Polo Jeans, Coca-Cola, Pantene, Miller Lite, Neutrogena, Delta Airlines and Tommy Hilfiger, to name a few.
      
      In 2015, Bella Agency was named one of the top 10 agencies in New York.
      
      With over 50 years of combined experience, Bella's team of agents has developed some of the most promising new models and talent in the business. Through dedication and creativity, we pride ourselves on providing a personalized, hands-on experience.
